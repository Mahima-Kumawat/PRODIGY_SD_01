This program converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales. It prompts the user to input a temperature value along with its original unit of measurement. The program then converts the given temperature into the other two units and displays the results. For example, if the user enters 25 degrees Celsius, the program will convert it to Fahrenheit and Kelvin and display the converted values as output.
